## Installation

To initialize the database, create a new database in your local/localhost route called "fs-react-shopping". Inside of that database, using Postico or another SQL app, run the SQL queries provided in database.sql to get the initial table up and running with some test data.

Download the repository and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you do not already have node.  With the folder open in your terminal, run 'npm install' inside the terminal window. Run 'npm run server' inside of this terminal window, and then open an additional terminal window inside the repository. Inside of this terminal window, run "npm run client".

## Usage

- Input fields at the top of the page allow the user to submit a item, quantity, and unit of that quantity.
- Once an item as been added to the list, there are 2 buttons to allow the user to either mark the item as purchased, or delete the item entirely
- If the task is completed, it will be moved to the back of the list, and the display will change to signify that it has been purchased.

## Built With

HTML, CSS, javascript, React, node, express, axios, postgresql.
